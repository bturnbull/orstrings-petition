<p class='lead'>
To all supporters of arts and music education at
<a href='http://www.orcsd.org'>Oyster River Cooperative School District</a>
in Durham, New Hampshire &mdash;
<strong>Welcome!</strong>
</p>
<p>
This site exists to provide information and advocate for the addition
of a curricular string music program to the existing music curricula at
Oyster River schools.  There is a
<a href="/petition">petition</a>
(now completed)
to gather and demonstrate community support to district administration
and the school board.
</p>
<div class='qanda'>
<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
<p>
The following is a list of questions and answers to provide background and
information on why and how to integrate string education at Oyster River.
It is intended to provide a framework for potential conversation and not as
a set of requirements.  How to develop and structure a string music
curriculum at Oyster River is definitively within the realm of
responsibility of our music department staff and district administration.
</p>
<p>
These questions and answers are distilled from conversations with music
educators throughout New Hampshire including Oyster River, Timberlane, and
University of New Hampshire.  This section also draws heavily on a 2012
proposal to incorporate curricular string instruction in the elementary
school day created and presented by Oyster River elementary music teacher,
Sarah Kuhn.
</p>
<div class='item'>
<h3>Is there interest in instrumental music at Oyster River?</h3>
<p>
Yes!  The band program at Oyster River is very strong.  The current rate
of participation in the elective band program among 4th grade students is
greater than 90%.  At the middle school, almost 40% of 7th and 8th grade
students are members in the elective band program.
</p>
</div>
<div class='item'>
<h3>Isn't band enough?</h3>
<p>
Offering only wind instruments fails to engage with students and parents
who indicate a preference to play a string orchestra instrument.  As shown,
most students do elect to participate in band &mdash; however some of
those students would choose to learn a string instrument, if given the
choice.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, many of the greatest works of western composers are music
solely for orchestra.  The presence of a string orchestra program in
the schools will expand all our students exposure to the great music
of our culture.
</p>
</div>
<div class='item'>
<h3>Why not include string instruments in band?</h3>
<p>
Orchestra music and wind ensemble music is very different &mdash;
especially music accessible to students new to an instrument.  Teaching
methods, exercises, and rate of progression also vary considerably
between wind and strings
</p>
<p>
For example, standard practice in public music education is to start
string instrument instruction in 3rd grade instead of 4th grade due to
increased difficulty mastering the more complex motor skills involved.
</p>
</div>
<div class='item'>
<h3>Why not an after-school program?</h3>
<p>
While the existing, 6th grade and below, Oyster River Elementary
Orchestra (OREO) program has seen great success these past few years,
holding instrumental lessons outside the school day instantly makes
the group elitist.  To participate, students require families whose
work schedules and financial situation affords them the flexibility
to drive their child to the program.  The public school system should
provide all children equal opportunity.
</p>
</div>
<div class='item'>
<h3>Will taking orchestra adversely impact academic performance?</h3>
<p>
Research has shown participation in school music programs does not
adversely impact academic performance.
</p>
<p>
Currently, 4th grade students electing both band and chorus are pulled
from their general classroom for lessons and rehearsal for approximately
120 minutes per week.  Standard music education programs allow students
to participate chorus and then choose band or orchestra, but not both.
Therefore, offering orchestra will not alter the amount of time 4th
grade music students are out of the general classroom.
</p>
<p>
Currently, 3rd grade students may elect to participate in chorus.  If
orchestra were to be available, the amount of time outside the general
classroom could be increased to possibly 90 minutes per week following
common practice.
</p>
<p>
As asserted above, pullout music programs do not adversely affect student
achievement when measured by standardized academic assessments.
